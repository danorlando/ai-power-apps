# AI Power Apps (WIP)

This site is a work in progress. It is a collection of AI Power Apps that I have created. I will be adding more as I create them. The first module is intended to be a clone of ChatGPT called ChatGPT+, which includes an extensive set of features beyond the original ChatGPT. 

A significant portion of the GPT+ code was taken from [Danny Avila's ChatGPT Clone](https://github.com/danny-avila/chatgpt-clone) project, with the frontend refactored to use Typescript, React Query, PrimeReact, Context API, CSS modules, testing library, and playwright e2e. I intend on refactoring the backend to use Fastify (possibly on Deno) instead of Express on NodeJS and Prisma ORM instead of mongoose. The backend will also be refactored to use typescript. I will also be adding Prisma ORM integration for MongoDB and a user management system. Again, this is a work in progress and additional features will be added once the core functionality is all working.

***IMPORTANT*** 
A large portion of this code is not yet functional. I've published it here to discuss the design and implementation with the community.
